A collection of small projects built from scratch as an introduction to programming. This repository documents my early journey into coding — primarily human-created, minimal AI assistance.

 About This Repository

✅ Human-written code
✅ Built from scratch
✅ Beginner friendly
✅ Minimal AI assistance
